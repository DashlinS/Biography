  The challenge was to the best of my current ability, using floats, to recreate the website Biography.com and its Bio on Stan "the man" Lee. Also as a tribute to the legend himself! Once again, the goal is to learn as much as I can from the these challenges and record progress! Will continue to update as I learn new tools and techniques.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html

The Html consisted of a some lists an `aside` bar and a lot of `icons`. Placement was very important here, to properly float the sections. I also included `span` to recreate the websites italic and underlined words.  

### CSS

The CSS was made using `floats`. The fonts used were not exact, but they were close enough to what I needed. Added hovering effects where needed, including the icons. The original website including a `fixed` position on its top bar to go down as you travel. This part took some figuring out, but it came out good.


## Styling Effects

# What I Learned

I learned how to adjust and use icons displayed on my page. Font Awesome is a great website and tool! Also being straightforward and easy to use.

Fixed elements and the difficulties that could come with them. I figured out the fixed portion of this website after some trial and error.
